          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-base-color mb-4">
            One of the primary advantages of domiciliary care is that it allows
            seniors to maintain their independence. Unlike moving to a care
            facility, seniors can continue their daily routines and stay in a
            familiar environment while receiving the necessary support.

            Domiciliary care is tailored to the individual needs of each senior.
            Caregivers work closely with families to develop personalized care
            plans that address specific requirements, such as assistance with
            daily tasks, medication management, or specialized care for
            conditions like dementia.

            Being in a familiar environment provides a sense of comfort and
